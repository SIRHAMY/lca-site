Will be making a run for the Presidency in 2028, and I would appreciate your vote.",
    "aspects": "Lambda Chi Alpha is about creating lasting, life-long relationships with an awesome group of guys, and filling your college years with unforgettable memories. I honestly cannot imagine how I would've made it this far without the support of my fraternity brothers and the plethora of resources and opportunities this fraternity provides. Some of my favorite aspects of Lambda Chi include, but are definitely not limited to, Formal/Semiformal, Gamedays, Magic Carpet Ride, Gamedays, Chef Jon's hotfire chicken fings, Gamedays, Mason the puppy, Brotherhood Retreat, and, of course, Gamedays. There is no other experience that compares to being a brother in this fraternity. When I graduate I will be able to look back on my time at Tech and say, \"Yeah. I did it right.\"",
