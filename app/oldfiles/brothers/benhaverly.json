    "aspects": "My favorite part about Lambda Chi is the diversity we have in our brothers. There is no one stereotype that could be used to describe our chapter as a whole because there are so many people with unique interests here. You can always find someone else who shares your interests and find people to introduce you to new interests. Brothers are always there for you.",
