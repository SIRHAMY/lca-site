    "aspects": "I never thought I would meet so many different people who can appreciate you for who you are. I love Lambda Chi because I can turn to any of these people for help and they would not hesitate to be there for me. It is the best support group I could have ever asked for and they have helped me see the world in so many different ways. Meeting such a diverse set of people who I can get along with has opened my mind tremendously and taught me so much as a human being. Association with the entire brotherhood of Lambda Chi has genuinely made me a better person, which I know I couldn't say if I was anywhere else.",
