Georgia Tech is the only school I've ever wanted to attend and I've been a die hard fan since I was 7. I work for the football team. If you Hate georgia as much as any Yellow Jacket should then I'd have a beer with you.",
    "aspects": "I've always had a great time in this house, whenever I've ever needed anything my brothers have been there for me and I like to think I've returned the favor a time or two. I wasn't from around here so this experience gave me a network of people that I could rely on.",
