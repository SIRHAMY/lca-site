    "description": "I go by Wandy. BK 1968. I'm a 2nd year Industrial Engineering major from Milton, GA. Love Georgia Tech even through the headaches it will continue to give me. Graduated from Milton High School. Huge Atlanta sports fan. Love music and going to concerts. I'm told I look like Napoleon Dynamite.",
    "aspects": "There's no such thing as a \"stereotypical\" Lambda Chi. The diversity of the characters that make up this chapter is definitely our greatest trait in my opinion. You always know that no matter what walk you take in life, there will be a group of guys that you'll fit in with naturally at Lambda Chi. Surrounding myself with such a diverse group of guys to grow and learn with has been so valuable to me. On top of that I love our rich tradition, social involvement on campus, gamedays, formal/semiformal, mixers, philanthropy involvement, networking opportunities, and our ritual.",
