    "aspects": "My favorite aspects of Lambda Chi are definitely the traditions and the great opportunities that the fraternity offers. When it comes to traditions, there's nothing better than gamedays, formal and semiformal, senior stories, our fraternity songs, and all the great brotherhood events we have throughout the year. I can't imagine going to Georgia Tech without all of these. Also, being a Lambda Chi has opened so many doors academically and socially that I wouldn't have had otherwise. I owe much of my GPA, work experience, life experience, and campus involvement to this fraternity.",
