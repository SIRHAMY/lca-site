    "aspects": "The resources that are available and the brothers I have been surrounded by are the reason for many of my successes at Georgia Tech. Without this fraternity, I would have not been involved in many of the clubs and programs I have been a part of and would not have gotten my co-op. The best aspect of Lambda Chi is someone is always available and willing to help me if I'm having problems with school or even if I'm just looking to bro out. I love Lambda Chi and everything that has come with being a brother here. I've had some of the best memories of my life already and have met some of my best friends who I know will continue to be a factor in my life outside of college. I can confidently say joining Lambda Chi was the best decision of my college career.",
